Open Source Wifi Router Firmware

This is all the instruction to get both DD-WRT and OpenWRT working even as a dual boot if so desired.

Follow the corresponding folder with the pdf include for the full instruction. Reverting back to stock firmware and img is also included in case something goes wrong. But all this has been test multiple time without issues. This is mostly for my future reference but others are free to use it as they so desire.
